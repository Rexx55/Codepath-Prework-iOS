I would like to build an organization app with to-do lists, calenders, reminders, and clocks. Currently, there are different apps for each of these tasks on ios.
I would implement all these features in 1 app which would help you be organized. I would also think of ways to integrate these features togther so that you will
be able to see tasks on the calender and icons on the clock for small daily tasks at the set time.

## Notes

- I faced some challenges when I was connecting the UI button to the View Controller by using the assistant. Also, I was not able to make it so that when you press
  the button, the background color would change. I deleted the code and did the steps again which made it work. Other than that, I was able to build the app easily.
